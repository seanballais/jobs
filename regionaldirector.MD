# Regional Director

Aimed at building a presence for Developh in their geographic locality, regional directors expand Developh's reach by being the appointed person in their institution or locale to assist in project management, chapter establishment, and related work.

Regional Directors work to encourage the establishment of chapters in their locale and perform check ups, meetings, and help execute regional events for the promotion of Developh and its advocacies.

Let's connect communities. The Regional Director aims to expand Developh's presence in their geographic locality, assisting in project management, promoting and helping in chapter establishment, and being the main person reported to for any advancements and events. They care about technology thriving in the hubs of every area where a computer can blink on--and the next generation of creators through education, advocacy, empowerment, and opportunity.
