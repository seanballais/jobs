# Education Coordinator

Linking technology to education for impact. Education Coordinators connect with schools, communities, and other organizations to target communities that Developh can execute its initiatives with. This includes consulting with partners for outreaches, education campaigns, and others. Most importantly, Education Coordinators have a passion for education -- understanding and empathizing with different communities and ways we can learn from them.

Coordinators organize documents, conduct meetings, consult with both the education core and with external stakeholders, and strategize on ways to maximize our educational impact.

_Let's connect communities. The Regional Director aims to expand Developh's presence in their geographic locality, assisting in project management, promoting and helping in chapter establishment, and being the main person reported to for any advancements and events. They care about technology thriving in the hubs of every area where a computer can blink on--and the next generation of creators through education, advocacy, empowerment, and opportunity._

* Has previous interest or is passionate about technology, equality, and advocacy
* Understands their community and the spaces that technology can fill within them
* Has a strong heart and advocacy for education and volunteerism
* Can communicate well, is dependable, and open to networking
